# Community Patch 1221 HK
 Community speedrunning patch for Hollow Knight

Current goals:
1. global timer that constantly increases while in control. as of right now the best idea is to hook the same variable that livesplit polls, and remove all polling rng from timer. this should be the exact same as the tas timer.
2. reset on deletion of file
3. auto start on no timer running and creation of file
3. json to disable in game timer display
4. display times in livesplit
5. Create a json that constains the bind for resetting, and rebinding to controller (could be replaced by Overbind https://github.com/cjonas1999/OverBind), though optimally an ingame solution is created.
